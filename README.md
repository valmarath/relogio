Relógio (Clock) is a project made alongside my course in [B7Web](https://b7web.com.br/fullstack/?gclid=EAIaIQobChMI-7eYj5vT-QIVEz6RCh2VfgXQEAAYASAAEgJfifD_BwE&ref=I24108426I) in order to practice JavaScript. Basically, it's a clock made using JavaScript and CSS, with both the analog and digital versions of it working  at the same time.
